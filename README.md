# Programming Language 101

Welcome to Ryan Francis C. Romano - Programming Language 101 repository! This folder contains all the files and resources for the Programming Language 101 , including activities, assignments, and the exam.

## Folder Structure

The folder is organized as follows:
- Premid
- Midterm
- Prefinal
- Final

## Premid 
## Premid Activities
## Premid Exam

## Midterm 
## Midterm Activities

This folder contains the following activities, each demonstrating different programming concepts:

1. **Activity 1**: Install NumPy and verify the installation.
2. **Activity 2 (Individual)**: Create a NumPy array and print its properties (shape, data type, size).
3. **Activity 3 (Individual)**: Generate a 5x5 random NumPy array and perform
4. **Activity 4 (Pair Work)**: Compare different slicing and indexing techniques with a sample dataset.
5. **Activity 5 (Individual)**: Write: Takes a NumPy array as input, Normalizes its values to a range between 0 and 1, Returns the modified array.
6. **Activity 6 (Challenge)**: Create a function that takes two NumPy arrays and performs matrix multiplication, handling exceptions for mismatched dimensions.
7. **Activity 7 (Individual)**: Import NumPy and the math module, then: Generate an array of 10 random numbers. Apply mathematical operations (square root, logarithm, exponential) to each value.
8. **Activity 8 (Pair Work)**: Write a custom Python module containing two NumPy functions and import it into another script.

Each activity folder contains the respective code files, explanations, and any additional resources needed to understand the topic.

## Midterm Exam

The **Exam** folder contains the assessment for the course. It includes the exam paper and any additional materials required to complete the exam.

1. 11.15: Find the Second Largest Number in a List. Write a function to find the second largest number in a list.
2. 16.25: Find the Most Frequent Element in a List. Given a list, return the element that appears the most times.
3. 26-50: NumPy Challenge: Weather Data Analysis. Perform calculations on a dataset using NumPy.
